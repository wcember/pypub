<p><b>Venture capital</b> (<b>VC</b>) is <a title="Financial capital">financial capital</a> provided to early-stage, high-potential, <a title="Growth investing">growth</a> <a title="Startup company">startup companies</a>. The venture capital <a title="Collective investment scheme">fund</a> earns money by owning <a title="Equity (finance)">equity</a> in the companies it invests in, which usually have a novel technology or <a title="Business model">business model</a> in high technology industries, such as <a title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, <a title="Information technology">IT</a> and <a title="Software">software</a>.

Venture capital is a type of <a title="Private equity">private equity</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-PrivCo_1-0" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to <a title="Angel investing" class="mw-redirect">angel investing</a> and other <a title="Seed funding" class="mw-redirect">seed funding</a> options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a <a title="Loan">bank loan</a> or complete a <a title="Debt">debt offering</a>. In exchange for the high <a title="Financial risk">risk</a> that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and less mature companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the company's ownership (and consequently value).</p>
<p>Venture capital is also associated with job creation (accounting for 2% of US GDP),<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> the <a title="Knowledge economy">knowledge economy</a>, and used as a proxy measure of <a title="Innovation">innovation</a> within an economic sector or geography. Every year, there are nearly 2 million businesses created in the USA, and 600–800 get venture capital funding. According to the <a title="National Venture Capital Association">National Venture Capital Association</a>, 11% of private sector jobs come from venture backed companies and venture backed revenue accounts for 21% of US GDP.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It is also a way in which public and private sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates networks for the new firms and industries, so that they can progress. This institution helps in identifying and combining pieces of companies, like finance, technical expertise, know-hows of marketing and business models. Once integrated, these enterprises succeed by becoming nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>A venture may be defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment. With few exceptions, private equity in the first half of the 20th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families. The Wallenbergs, Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Rockefellers, and Warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century. In 1938, <a title="Laurance S.

<p>One of the first steps toward a professionally-managed venture capital industry was the passage of the <a title="Small Business Investment Act of 1958" class="mw-redirect">Small Business Investment Act of 1958</a>. The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. <a title="Small Business Administration">Small Business Administration</a> (SBA) to license private "Small Business Investment Companies" (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies. More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical, or data-processing technology. As a result, venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance. An early West Coast venture capital company was Draper and Johnson Investment Company, formed in 1962<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> by <a title="William Henry Draper III">William Henry Draper III</a> and Franklin P. Johnson, Jr. In 1965, Sutter Hill Ventures acquired the portfolio of Draper and Johnson as a founding action. Bill Draper and Paul Wythes were the founders, and Pitch Johnson formed Asset Management Company at that time.</p>
<p>It is commonly noted that the first venture-backed startup is <a title="Fairchild Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> (which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit), funded in 1959 by what would later become <a title="Venrock Associates" class="mw-redirect">Venrock Associates</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Venrock was founded in 1969 by <a title="Laurance S. Rockefeller" class="mw-redirect">Laurance S. Rockefeller</a>, the fourth of <a title="John D. Rockefeller, Jr.">John D. Rockefeller's</a> six children as a way to allow other Rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments.</p>
<p>It was also in the 1960s that the common form of <a title="Private equity fund">private equity fund</a>, still in use today, emerged. <a title="Private equity firm">Private equity firms</a> organized <a title="Limited partnerships" class="mw-redirect">limited partnerships</a> to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as <a title="General partner">general partner</a> and the investors, who were passive <a title="Limited partners" class="mw-redirect">limited partners</a>, put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1.0–2.5% and a <a title="Carried interest">carried interest</a> typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.</p>
<p>The growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on <a title="Sand Hill Road">Sand Hill Road</a>, beginning with <a title="Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers" class="mw-redirect">Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers</a> and <a title="Sequoia Capital">Sequoia Capital</a> in 1972. Located in <a title="Menlo Park, CA" class="mw-redirect">Menlo Park, CA</a>, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many <a title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> companies based in the <a title="Santa Clara Valley">Santa Clara Valley</a> as well as early <a title="Computer">computer</a> firms using their devices and programming and service companies.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the <a title="National Venture Capital Association">National Venture Capital Association</a> (NVCA). The NVCA was to serve as the <a title="Industry trade group" class="mw-redirect">industry trade group</a> for the venture capital industry.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.</p>
<p>It was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million. With the passage of the <a title="Employee Retirement Income Security Act">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in <a title="Privately held" class="mw-redirect">privately held</a> companies. In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain of the ERISA restrictions, under the "<a title="Prudent man rule">prudent man rule</a>,"<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1980s">1980s</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a title="Edit section: 1980s">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., <a title="Digital Equipment Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, <a title="Apple Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>, <a title="Genentech">Genentech</a>) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms. From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major "home run". The number of firms multiplied, and the capital managed by these firms increased from $3 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.<sup id="cite_ref-VCVigor_17-0" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns, and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time. In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors impacted returns. The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987 and foreign corporations, particularly from Japan and Korea, flooded early stage companies with capital.<sup id="cite_ref-VCVigor_17-1" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including <a title="General Electric">General Electric</a> and <a title="Paine Webber">Paine Webber</a> either sold off or closed these venture capital units. Additionally, venture capital units within <a title="Chemical Banking" class="mw-redirect">Chemical Bank</a> and <a title="Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company" class="mw-redirect">Continental Illinois National Bank</a>, among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies.

<p>By the end of the 1980s, venture capital returns were relatively low, particularly in comparison with their emerging <a title="Leveraged buyout">leveraged buyout</a> cousins, due in part to the competition for hot startups, excess supply of IPOs and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers. Growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, increasing from $3 billion in 1983 to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994.</p>
<p>After a shakeout of venture capital managers, the more successful firms retrenched, focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments. Results would begin to turn very attractive, successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the 1990s. Yale School of Management Professor Andrew Metrick refers to these first 15 years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in 1980 as the "pre-boom period" in anticipation of the boom that would begin in 1995 and last through the bursting of the <a title="Internet bubble" class="mw-redirect">Internet bubble</a> in 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The late 1990s were a boom time for venture capital, as firms on <a title="Sand Hill Road">Sand Hill Road</a> in <a title="Menlo Park, California">Menlo Park</a> and <a title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent Internet and other computer technologies.

<p>The <a title="Nasdaq" class="mw-redirect">Nasdaq</a> crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed.

Venture capital investors sought to reduce size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds, and, in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the <a title="Private equity secondary market">secondary market</a>. By mid-2003, the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its 2001 capacity. Nevertheless, PricewaterhouseCoopers's MoneyTree Survey<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> shows that total venture capital investments held steady at 2003 levels through the second quarter of 2005.</p>
<p>Although the post-boom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995. As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004. The revival of an <a title="Internet">Internet</a>-driven environment in 2004 through 2007 helped to revive the venture capital environment. However, as a percentage of the overall private equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.</p>
<p>Venture capital funds, which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in 2000 (the height of the <a title="Dot-com bubble">dot-com bubble</a>), raised only $25.1 billion in 2006, a 2%-decline from 2005 and a significant decline from its peak.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan from a lender. Lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital, irrespective of the success or failure of a business. Venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business. As a shareholder, the venture capitalist's return is dependent on the growth and profitability of the business. This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist "exits" by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in; as a result, firms are looking for the extremely rare, yet sought after, qualities, such as innovative technology, potential for rapid growth, a well-developed business model, and an impressive management team. Of these qualities, funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing the financial returns and successful exit event within the required timeframe (typically 3–7 years) that venture capitalists expect.</p>
<p>Because investments are <a title="Illiquid" class="mw-redirect">illiquid</a> and require the extended timeframe to harvest, venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed <a title="Due diligence">due diligence</a> prior to investment. Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an <a title="Initial Public Offering" class="mw-redirect">IPO</a> stage when <a title="Valuation (finance)">valuations</a> are favourable. Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company's development:<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Business idea">Idea generation</a>;</li>

<li><a title="Ramp up">Ramp up</a>; and</li>
<li><a title="Exit Strategy" class="mw-redirect">Exit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as "Speed Venturing", which is akin to speed-dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether he wants a follow-up meeting. In addition, there are some new private online networks that are emerging to provide additional opportunities to meet investors.<sup id="cite_ref-news.bbc.co.uk_24-0" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>This need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies, and most suitable for businesses having large up-front <a title="Capital requirement">capital requirements</a>, which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt. That is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software, and other intellectual property, whose value is unproven. In turn, this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fast-growing <a title="High-tech" class="mw-redirect">technology</a> and <a title="Life sciences">life sciences</a> or <a title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> fields.</p>
<p>If a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan, a good management team, investment and passion from the founders, a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle, and target minimum returns in excess of 40% per year, it will find it easier to raise venture capital.</p>

<p>A venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments, and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments. A venture capital fund refers to a <a title="Collective investment scheme">pooled investment</a> vehicle (in the United States, often an <a title="Limited partnership">LP</a> or <a title="Limited liability company">LLC</a>) that primarily invests the <a title="Financial capital">financial capital</a> of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard <a title="Capital market">capital markets</a> or <a title="Loan">bank loans</a>. These funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm, which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.</p>
<p>A core skill within VC is the ability to identify novel technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments versus taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.</p>

<p>Venture Capitalist firms differ in their approaches. There are multiple factors, and each firm is different.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that influence VC decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business situation: Some VCs tend to invest in new ideas, or fledgling companies. Others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow.</li>
<li>Some invest solely in certain industries.</li>
<li>Some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally.</li>
<li>VC expectations often vary. Some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth. The amount of help a VC provides can vary from one firm to the next.</li>

<p>Within the venture capital industry, the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as "venture capitalists" or "VCs". Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background. Venture capitalists with an operational background (<a title="Operating partner">operating partner</a>) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants. Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have <a title="Investment banking">investment banking</a> or other <a title="Corporate finance">corporate finance</a> experience.</p>

<p>Most <a title="Private equity fund">venture capital funds</a> have a fixed life of 10 years, with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity. The investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years, after which the focus is managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio. This model was pioneered by successful funds in <a title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> through the 1980s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance, and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product.</p>
<p>In such a fund, the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently "called down" by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments. There are substantial penalties for a limited partner (or investor) that fails to participate in a <a title="Capital call">capital call</a>.</p>
<p>It can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund. At the time when all of the money has been raised, the fund is said to be closed, and the 10-year lifetime begins. Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised. The <a title="Vintage year">vintage year</a> generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison. This<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them.</p>
<p>From investors' point of view, funds can be: (1) <a title="Private equity fund">traditional</a>—where all the investors invest with equal terms; or (2) <a title="Asymmetric fund">asymmetric</a>—where different investors have different terms. Typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where there's an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life, larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time; doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged. Smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts; by the time the fund cashes out, an entirely-new generation of technologies and people is ascending, whom the general partners may not know well, and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternatives">Alternatives</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a title="Edit section: Alternatives">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments, many entrepreneurs seek <a title="Seed funding" class="mw-redirect">seed funding</a> from <a title="Angel investors" class="mw-redirect">angel investors</a>, who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities, or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a <a title="Start-up company" class="mw-redirect">start-up company</a> otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance <a title="Sweat equity">sweat equity</a> until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or <a title="Angel investors" class="mw-redirect">angel investors</a>. This practice is called "<a title="Bootstrapping (business)" class="mw-redirect">bootstrapping</a>".</p>
<p>There has been some debate since the dot com boom that a "funding gap" has developed between the friends and family investments typically in the $0 to $250,000 range and the amounts that most VC funds prefer to invest between $1 million to $2 million.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This funding gap may be accentuated by the fact that some successful VC funds have been drawn to raise ever-larger funds, requiring them to search for correspondingly larger investment opportunities. This gap is often filled by <a title="Sweat equity">sweat equity</a> and <a title="Seed funding" class="mw-redirect">seed funding</a> via <a title="Angel investors" class="mw-redirect">angel investors</a> as well as equity investment companies who specialize in investments in <a title="Startup companies" class="mw-redirect">startup companies</a> from the range of $250,000 to $1 million. The National Venture Capital Association estimates that the latter now invest more than $30 billion a year in the USA in contrast to the $20 billion a year invested by organized venture capital funds.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p><a title="Crowd funding" class="mw-redirect">Crowd funding</a> is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital. Crowd funding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations. While such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity, it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs such as independent film makers, now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost. Some crowd funding models are also being applied for startup funding such as those listed at <a title="Comparison of crowd funding services">Comparison of crowd funding services</a>. One of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional VC model. The traditional VCs are shifting their focus to later-stage investments, and <a title="Return on investment">return on investment</a> of many VC funds have been low or negative.<sup id="cite_ref-news.bbc.co.uk_24-1" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In Europe and India, <a title="Media for equity">Media for equity</a> is a partial alternative to venture capital funding. Media for equity investors are able to supply start-ups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity.</p>
<p>In industries where assets can be <a title="Securitization">securitized</a> effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of <a title="Foreclosure">foreclosure</a>, businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth. Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries. Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV (<a title="Special purpose vehicle" class="mw-redirect">special purpose vehicle</a>): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks, groups have emerged, which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Canada also has a fairly unique form of venture capital generation in its <a title="Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporation" class="mw-redirect">Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCC)</a>. These funds, also known as Retail Venture Capital or Labour Sponsored Investment Funds (LSIF), are generally sponsored by labor unions and offer <a title="Tax breaks" class="mw-redirect">tax breaks</a> from government to encourage retail investors to purchase the funds. Generally, these Retail Venture Capital funds only invest in companies where the majority of employees are in Canada. However, innovative structures have been developed to permit LSVCCs to direct in Canadian subsidiaries of corporations incorporated in jurisdictions outside of Canada.</p>

<p>The Southern African venture capital industry is developing.</p>
<p>South Africa, with the help of the South African Government and Revenue Service, has realized the necessity to follow the international trend of using tax efficient vehicles to propel economic growth and job creation through venture capital. Section 12 J of the Income Tax Act was updated to include Venture Capital Companies allowing a tax efficient structure similar to VCT's in the UK. Section 12 J provides investors the opportunity to invest in Venture Capital through a tax efficient structure.</p>
<p>Despite the above structure Government needs to adjust regulation around intellectual property, exchange control and other legislation to ensure that Venture Capital succeeds in South Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, there are not many Venture Capital Funds in operation and it is a small community however funds are available. Funds are difficult to come by and very few firms have managed to get funding despite demonstrating tremendous growth potential.</p>
<p>The majority of the venture capital in Southern Africa is centered around South Africa and Kenya.</p>
